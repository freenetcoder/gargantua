# Gargantua Protocol Specification

## Abstract

The Gargantua Protocol is a zero-knowledge anonymous payment system built on Solana that provides complete transaction privacy without requiring a trusted setup. The protocol uses Pedersen commitments, Bulletproofs, and Schnorr signatures to enable anonymous transfers while maintaining the performance characteristics of the Solana blockchain.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Traditional blockchain transactions are pseudonymous but not anonymous. All transaction details including sender, receiver, and amounts are publicly visible, creating privacy concerns for individuals and enterprises. Existing privacy solutions either require trusted setups, have poor performance, or lack integration with high-throughput blockchains.

Gargantua Protocol addresses these limitations by providing:
- **True anonymity** without trusted setup
- **High performance** leveraging Solana's architecture  
- **Practical usability** with sub-second finality
- **Economic efficiency** with minimal transaction costs

### 1.2 Design Goals

1. **Privacy**: Complete unlinkability of transactions
2. **Performance**: Sub-second transaction finality
3. **Trustlessness**: No trusted setup required
4. **Compatibility**: Works with existing SPL tokens
5. **Scalability**: Supports high transaction throughput
6. **Auditability**: Cryptographic proofs ensure correctness

## 2. Cryptographic Foundations

### 2.1 Elliptic Curve Group

The protocol operates over the Ristretto255 group, which provides:
- **128-bit security level**
- **Prime order group** (no cofactor issues)
- **Efficient operations** with optimized implementations
- **Canonical encoding** preventing malleability

**Group Parameters**:
- **Curve**: Curve25519
- **Field**: F_p where p = 2^255 - 19
- **Order**: ℓ = 2^252 + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493

### 2.2 Pedersen Commitments

Pedersen commitments hide values while preserving additive homomorphism.

**Commitment Scheme**:
```
Com(v, r) = g^v · h^r
```

Where:
- `g, h` are independent generators
- `v` is the committed value
- `r` is the blinding factor (randomness)

**Properties**:
- **Hiding**: Computationally indistinguishable from random
- **Binding**: Computationally infeasible to find collisions
- **Homomorphic**: Com(v₁, r₁) · Com(v₂, r₂) = Com(v₁ + v₂, r₁ + r₂)

### 2.3 Bulletproofs

Bulletproofs provide efficient zero-knowledge range proofs without trusted setup.

**Range Proof**: Proves that a committed value v satisfies 0 ≤ v < 2^n

**Proof Size**: O(log n) group elements
**Verification Time**: O(n) group operations
**Prover Time**: O(n) group operations

**Aggregation**: Multiple range proofs can be aggregated for efficiency.

### 2.4 Schnorr Signatures

Used for account registration and authentication.

**Signature Scheme**:
```
Sign(m, x) = (R, s) where:
R = g^k (for random k)
s = k + H(R, P, m) · x
```

**Verification**:
```
Verify(m, P, (R, s)) = (g^s == R · P^H(R, P, m))
```

## 3. Protocol Architecture

### 3.1 Account Model

The protocol uses an account-based model with the following account types:

#### 3.1.1 Anonymous Accounts

Each user maintains an anonymous account identified by a public key derived from a private key.

```rust
struct ZerosolAccount {
    commitment_left: G1Point,   // CLn - left commitment
    commitment_right: G1Point,  // CRn - right commitment  
    public_key: G1Point,        // Anonymous public key
    last_rollover: u64,         // Last epoch update
    is_registered: bool,        // Registration status
}
```

**Commitment Semantics**:
- `commitment_left`: Represents the account balance
- `commitment_right`: Used for transaction linkability prevention

#### 3.1.2 Pending Accounts

Temporary storage for commitment updates within an epoch.

```rust
struct PendingAccount {
    commitment_left: G1Point,   // Pending balance update
    commitment_right: G1Point,  // Pending linkability update
}
```

#### 3.1.3 Global State

System-wide configuration and parameters.

```rust
struct GlobalState {
    authority: Pubkey,          // Program authority
    token_mint: Pubkey,         // Supported token
    epoch_length: u64,          // Epoch duration
    fee: u64,                   // Transaction fee
    current_epoch: u64,         // Current epoch number
}
```

### 3.2 Epoch System

The protocol operates in discrete epochs to batch transactions and enhance privacy.

**Epoch Properties**:
- **Duration**: Configurable (typically 1 hour)
- **Rollover**: Account commitments are updated between epochs
- **Batching**: Multiple transactions processed together
- **Privacy**: Temporal unlinkability across epochs

**Epoch Transition**:
1. Pending commitments are added to main commitments
2. Pending accounts are reset to zero
3. Epoch counter is incremented
4. New transactions begin in the new epoch

### 3.3 Nullifier System

Prevents double-spending while maintaining anonymity.

```rust
struct NonceState {
    nonce: [u8; 32],    // Unique nullifier
    epoch: u64,         // Epoch when used
    used: bool,         // Usage flag
}
```

**Nullifier Generation**:
```
nullifier = H(private_key, transaction_data, epoch)
```

## 4. Protocol Operations

### 4.1 Account Registration

Users register anonymous accounts using Schnorr signatures.

**Process**:
1. Generate keypair `(x, P = g^x)`
2. Create Schnorr signature on program ID
3. Submit registration transaction
4. Program verifies signature and creates account

**Security**: Links the anonymous account to a one-time signature without revealing the private key.

### 4.2 Deposit (Fund)

Users deposit tokens into the anonymous pool.

**Process**:
1. User specifies deposit amount `v`
2. Generate random blinding factor `r`
3. Create commitment `C = Com(v, r)`
4. Transfer tokens to program custody
5. Update account commitment: `CL_new = CL_old + C`

**Privacy**: Only the deposit amount is visible; subsequent balance is hidden.

### 4.3 Anonymous Transfer

Core privacy-preserving operation transferring value between anonymous accounts.

**Participants**:
- **Senders**: Accounts providing input value
- **Receivers**: Accounts receiving output value  
- **Relayer**: Submits transaction and receives fee

**Process**:
1. **Input Preparation**:
   - Select input accounts with sufficient balance
   - Generate input commitments `C_i = Com(v_i, r_i)`
   - Create nullifiers to prevent double-spending

2. **Output Generation**:
   - Specify output amounts and recipients
   - Generate output commitments `C_o = Com(v_o, r_o)`
   - Ensure balance conservation: `Σv_i = Σv_o + fee`

3. **Proof Generation**:
   - Generate range proofs for all amounts
   - Create balance conservation proof
   - Generate ownership proofs for inputs

4. **Transaction Submission**:
   - Relayer submits transaction with proofs
   - Program verifies all proofs
   - Update account commitments if valid

**Zero-Knowledge Proof**:
The transfer proof demonstrates:
- **Range**: All amounts are in valid range [0, 2^32)
- **Balance**: Input sum equals output sum plus fee
- **Ownership**: Prover knows private keys for input accounts
- **Consistency**: Commitments are well-formed

### 4.4 Withdrawal (Burn)

Users withdraw tokens from anonymous accounts.

**Process**:
1. Generate burn proof showing:
   - Ownership of account
   - Sufficient balance for withdrawal
   - Amount is in valid range
2. Submit burn transaction with proof
3. Program verifies proof and transfers tokens
4. Update account commitment: `CL_new = CL_old - Com(amount, 0)`

## 5. Zero-Knowledge Proofs

### 5.1 Range Proofs

Prove that committed values are within valid ranges without revealing the values.

**Construction**: Uses Bulletproofs with inner product arguments.

**Proof Elements**:
- **Commitment**: `V = Com(v, γ)`
- **Generators**: `g, h, u` and vectors `G, H`
- **Proof**: `(A, S, T₁, T₂, τₓ, μ, ⟨l, r⟩)`

**Verification Equation**:
```
g^t̂ h^τₓ = V^z² T₁^x T₂^x²
```

### 5.2 Balance Conservation Proofs

Ensure that the sum of inputs equals the sum of outputs plus fees.

**Constraint**:
```
Σᵢ Com(vᵢ, rᵢ) = Σⱼ Com(v'ⱼ, r'ⱼ) + Com(fee, 0)
```

**Implementation**: Uses the homomorphic property of Pedersen commitments.

### 5.3 Ownership Proofs

Prove knowledge of private keys for input accounts without revealing them.

**Construction**: Schnorr-based proof of discrete logarithm knowledge.

**Proof**: `(c, s)` such that `g^s = R · P^c` where `c = H(R, P, m)`

### 5.4 Constraint System Verification

Complex proofs use R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint Systems) for verification.

**R1CS Triple**: `(A, B, C)` such that `(A · w) ∘ (B · w) = C · w`

Where:
- `w` is the witness vector
- `∘` denotes element-wise multiplication
- `A, B, C` are constraint matrices
