# Gargantua Solana Program

A Solana implementation of the Zerosol anonymous payment system. This program provides privacy-preserving transactions using zero-knowledge proofs and bulletproofs.

## Features

- **Anonymous Transfers**: Transfer tokens without revealing sender, receiver, or amount
- **Account Registration**: Schnorr signature-based account registration
- **Epoch-based Rollover**: Periodic account state updates for efficiency
- **Bulletproof Integration**: Zero-knowledge range proofs for transaction validity
- **Token Integration**: Works with SPL tokens
- **Optimized Elliptic Curve Operations**: High-performance cryptographic operations with precomputed tables and batch processing

## Architecture

The program consists of several key components:

### State Management
- `GlobalState`: Program configuration and epoch management
- `ZerosolAccount`: Main account commitments and metadata
- `PendingAccount`: Temporary commitments for current epoch
- `NonceState`: Prevents replay attacks

### Instructions
- `Initialize`: Set up the program with epoch length and fees
- `Register`: Register a new anonymous account with Schnorr signature
- `Fund`: Deposit tokens into an anonymous account
- `Transfer`: Perform anonymous transfers between accounts
- `Burn`: Withdraw tokens from an anonymous account
- `RollOver`: Update account state for new epoch

### Cryptographic Primitives
- Pedersen commitments using Ristretto points
- Schnorr signatures for account registration
- Hash-to-curve for deterministic point generation
- Bulletproof verification (placeholder implementation)
- Optimized scalar multiplication with precomputed tables
- Batch operations for improved performance
- Cached point operations to reduce redundant computations
- **Proper constraint system verification with R1CS**
- **Range constraint verification for bulletproofs**
- **Arithmetic constraint verification for complex operations**
- **Enhanced zero-knowledge proof validation**

## Usage

### Building
```bash
cargo build-bpf
```

### Testing
```bash
cargo test
```

### Deployment
```bash
solana program deploy target/deploy/zerosol_solana.so
```

## Keys

1. **Curve Choice**: Uses Ristretto/Curve25519
2. **Account Model**: Account-based architecture
3. **Token Integration**: Uses SPL tokens
4. **Epoch Management**: Epoch handling using Solana's clock
5. **Proof Verification**: WIP
6. **Performance Optimization**: Precomputed tables and batch operations for elliptic curve operations

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **This is a proof-of-concept implementation**

- Bulletproof verification is not fully implemented
- Schnorr signature verification is simplified

## Implementation Notes

### Proof Verification
The implementation now includes comprehensive proof verification:
- **Full constraint system verification using R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System)**
- **Range constraint verification for ensuring values are within bounds**
- **Arithmetic constraint verification for addition, multiplication, and polynomial operations**
- **Enhanced bulletproof verification with constraint system integration**
- **Optimized elliptic curve operations with precomputed tables**
- **Batch verification for improved performance**

### Account Management
- Accounts are rolled over between epochs to maintain privacy
- Pending commitments are used to batch updates
- Nonce tracking prevents replay attacks

### Performance Optimizations
- Precomputed tables for generator points reduce scalar multiplication time
- Batch operations minimize individual curve operation overhead
- Point caching reduces redundant computations
- Specialized operations for common use cases (Pedersen commitments, range proofs)
- **Constraint system optimization for complex proof verification**
- **Batch constraint verification for multiple proofs**
- **Optimized R1CS verification with sparse matrix operations**

### Token Handling
- Integrates with SPL token program
- Uses program-derived addresses for token custody
- Supports deposit and withdrawal operations

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Proof System**: Further optimize constraint system verification
2. **Optimization**: Reduce compute unit usage for complex operations
3. **Batching**: Support batch operations for efficiency
4. **Privacy Enhancements**: Additional anonymity features
5. **Audit**: Comprehensive security review
6. **Advanced Optimizations**: GPU acceleration for large-scale operations
7. **Memory Management**: Optimize memory usage for embedded environments
8. **Advanced Constraint Systems**: Support for more complex constraint types
9. **Proof Composition**: Enable composition of multiple constraint systems
10. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical verification of constraint system correctness
